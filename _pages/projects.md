title: Supersymmetric black holes
description: This project focuses on studying supersymmetric (SUSY) black holes at long times. The [short paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00407) gives a summary of the analysis. The [more technical paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00407) gives a detailed account of the project.

title: Unruh effect analogue in coupled harmonic oscillator systems
description: The goal of this project is to demonstrate that the difficulty of detecting Unruh radiation in Minkowski spacetime can be overcome by using a mathematically analogous system to model it. In this way, we are able to measure the effect in a different setting while still accounting for the systemâ€™s most basic features. We show that the necessary system can be found by considering a pair of coupled optical cavities. We outline how detection of radiation is to be performed in both systems, and how the two processes are related to each other.
